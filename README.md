This project leverages Payload CMS to build a sophisticated content management system and website that enables online class booking and management.
- Class Booking Workflow: Users can book online classes. When a class is added, the system automatically generates a unique class link.
- Payment Automation: Upon booking, an automation process handles payments via PayPal or Stripe and distributes the class link to users.
- Admin CMS: Built on Payload CMS, allowing administrators to easily manage classes, bookings, and content through a sleek, code-centric interface.
- Automation-Driven: Class date entry directly triggers link creation and notifies participants, streamlining the entire booking process.
